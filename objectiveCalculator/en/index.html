			The 1 with tabs.
		</h1>

		<p>
			With your current calculator, you have to erase your equation everytime you need to calculate something else. That's a thing from the past with Objective Calculator! With tabs, you have virtually an unlimited number of calculators on the tip of your fingers. Most problems require multiple calculations, so oppening new tabs is the natural thing to do!

	<div class="centralContainer">
		<h1>
			Equals button? Zeroed!
		</h1>
		<p>
			The equals key is a carry-over from the older physical calculators with very weak processing power. Technically, your device is much more capable than that, so all the calculations can be solved in real-time, without the need to type everything and only then pressing the equals button. With Objective Calculator, your result will be there instantaneously!
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="centralContainer">
