            <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Tracking</strong>: MinersPal does not track your
                    activity within the app or across other apps or websites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Personal Association</strong>: Any data
                    collected, such as miner stats or community interactions, is
                    not linked to any personally identifiable information beyond
                    your email address, which is used solely for account-related
                    purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anonymous Usage</strong>: Where possible, we ensure
                    that your mining data is anonymized and not associated with
                    personal details.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third

                share your miner setups with other users within the MinersPal
                community. If you choose to do so, only the miner stats you
                provide will be visible to other users—your personal identity
                will remain private.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take reasonable measures to protect your data from
                unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no
                method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage
                is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
